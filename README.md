OpenL3 audio model weights, in numpy format

[OpenL3](https://openl3.readthedocs.io/) is a multi-modal model for
computing embeddings for your audio files, images, and videos.

These datafiles are the weights for the audio model layers, in numpy
format for portability to different machine learning libraries.
They have been converted from tensorflow format.
